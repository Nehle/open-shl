#open-shl

Node.js client for the open SHL (Swedish Hockey League) API. Developed with and for node.js 5+

## Install

`npm install --save open-shl`

## Usage

First make sure you have a valid `clientId` and `clientSecret` for the API, 
which can be gained by emailing support@shl.se

After that, you can access the api thusly:

```javascript
const shl = require("open-shl");
const options = {
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    userAgent: "YourUserAgent" // Optional 
}
const client = shl.connect(options);
```

### The SHL API

This client is built to mimic the API as documented on http://doc.openapi.shl.se

Many methods support extra query parameters, if they are supported in the API 
they can be supplied in an optional `query` argument as final (or only) parameter 
to the matching method. Most of the time this is the `teamId`, which is supplied
as an array of three letter team codes.
